make read only

A few small (and pretty ugly) bash scripts to set up a readonly rootfs and mount /var and /home as a tmpfs fusing it with it's original content saved in /ro. Additionally ther is a script making changes in /var and /home persistent, a script mounting / rw and a script mounting / ro.

Going to be improved soon!
